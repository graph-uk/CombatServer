              If it is defined explicitly - test will be run with each of all provided values.
              If it is not defined - test will be run with each of all accepted values.
              If the test has two or more enum parameters - test will be run with all combinations of parameters.
              For example (uk;desktop uk;mobile ru;desktop ru;mobile etc...)
